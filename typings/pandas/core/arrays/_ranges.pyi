    Generate a range of dates or timestamps with the spans between dates
    described by the given `freq` DateOffset.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start : Timedelta, Timestamp or None
        First point of produced date range.
    end : Timedelta, Timestamp or None
        Last point of produced date range.
    periods : int or None
        Number of periods in produced date range.
    freq : Tick
        Describes space between dates in produced date range.
    unit : str, default "ns"
        The resolution the output is meant to represent.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray[np.int64]
        Representing the given resolution.
